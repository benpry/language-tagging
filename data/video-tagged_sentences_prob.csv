Gold - Goal

By the way: the green blocks are, basically, the main gimmick for this world — greens determine, both, your success and your failure

You, yourself, cannot ""pass"" through greens

Green block interaction ""rules"":
versus Green - does not move other greens
v. Light Red - pushes block in the direction you're pushing the green
v. Red - consumes red; green then continues in direction you're pushing
v. Gold - consumes block; counts as ""win"" if you do this
